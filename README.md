# CS 4400 Phase 4 Project - Drone Dispatch System
### Project Description + Instructions to Run/Set-up
This project is a drone-dispatch system that allows the user to view the tables and views in our drone-dispatch database while also providing capabilities for the user to execute various stored procedures. 

To setup the project, download all of the app files and run the database script containing the tables, views, and stored procedures. 

To run the project, there are two main steps:
1. **Start up the server**: Navigate to the server directory of the project and run `node index.js` in your terminal to start the server.

2. **Start the frontend**: In a separate terminal, in the client directory of the project, run `npm start` to start the locally hosted web page. 

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React JS - Used to develop the web pages
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express.js - Use this to connect to our database and call stored procedures
- **Database**: MySQL - Database containing tables, views, and stored procedures
